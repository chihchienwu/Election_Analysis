## Overall Election Audit Summary
With the script used for this election audit, similar analysis by candidate and county can be easily replicated. Additionally, the script can be used (with some changes) for higher level election with seperate polical parties and more candidate participation. If more data were collected from the ballot, such as age range and political leaning, the script can be modified to perform analysis that determine the breakout of the votes by age and political preferences.
